# Summary: Centralized LLM Configuration

## What Was Done

### Problem Identified
The system had **auto-detection logic** that would automatically switch LLM providers based on which API keys were present:
- If `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` was found → switch to Azure OpenAI
- If `OPENAI_API_KEY` was found → switch to OpenAI  
- Otherwise → use Groq (default)

This caused confusion because:
- ❌ Hard to predict which provider would be used
- ❌ Configuration logic scattered across multiple files
- ❌ Misleading comments in `.env` suggesting OpenAI would be "prioritized"
- ❌ Difficult to explicitly test with specific providers

### Solution Implemented

**Created a centralized LLM factory** that provides a single point of configuration for all LLM and embedding providers.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **New File: `src/utils/llm_factory.py`**
   - Central factory class (`LLMFactory`) for creating LLM and embedding instances
   - Loads configuration from both `.env` and `settings.yaml`
   - Provides singleton pattern via `get_factory()`
   - Validates configuration and warns about missing API keys
   - **No auto-detection** - uses explicit `PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER` setting

### 2. **Modified: `src/utils/multi_llm.py`**
   - **Removed** the auto-detection logic in `_initialize_llms()` method
   - Removed automatic provider switching based on API key presence
   - Now respects the explicitly configured `primary_provider` parameter
   - Simplified initialization to check for keys inline per provider

### 3. **Modified: `src/api/routes.py`**
   - **Replaced** manual configuration loading with factory usage
   - Removed duplicate config loading and merging logic
   - Simplified to use `get_factory()` for all LLM/embedding creation
   - Much cleaner and more maintainable code

### 4. **Modified: `.env`**
   - Removed misleading comments about OpenAI being "prioritized"
   - Updated comments to indicate explicit configuration via `PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER`
   - Removed auto-detection messaging

### 5. **Modified: `README.md`**
   - Added comprehensive section on **LLM Provider Configuration**
   - Documented the centralized factory approach
   - Explained why centralized configuration is better
   - Provided examples for different provider configurations
   - Clear guidance on setting `PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER`

### 6. **Modified: `setup.bat` and `setup.sh`**
   - Updated setup instructions to mention provider configuration
   - Removed references to only OpenAI API key
   - Added instructions for configuring `PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER`

### 7. **New File: `LLM_CONFIGURATION_MIGRATION.md`**
   - Complete migration guide for users
   - Explains what changed and why
   - Step-by-step migration instructions
   - Configuration reference
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Code examples

## How It Works Now

### Configuration Priority (Highest to Lowest)
1. **Environment Variables** (`.env`) - Highest priority
2. **Settings File** (`settings.yaml`)
3. **Built-in Defaults**

### Provider Selection
```bash
# In .env - Explicit configuration required
PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER=groq  # Options: groq, openai, azure
PRIMARY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=sentence-transformers
```

### Usage in Code
```python
from src.utils.llm_factory import get_factory

# Get factory singleton
factory = get_factory()

# Create managers
llm_manager = factory.create_llm_manager()
embedder = factory.create_embedder()
config = factory.get_config()
```

## Benefits

### Before (Scattered + Auto-Detection)
- Configuration spread across `routes.py`, `multi_llm.py`, `.env`
- Auto-detection made behavior unpredictable
- Hard to test with specific providers
- Confusing for users

### After (Centralized + Explicit)
- ✅ Single source of truth (`llm_factory.py`)
- ✅ Explicit provider selection
- ✅ Predictable behavior
- ✅ Easy to test and maintain
- ✅ Clear configuration via environment variables
- ✅ Consistent usage across the entire application

---

## Migration Impact

### For Default Users (Groq)
- **No changes needed** - Groq is still the default
- System works exactly the same

### For OpenAI Users
- **Action required**: Set `PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai` in `.env`
- Previously relied on auto-detection

### For Azure Users
- **Action required**: Set `PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER=azure` in `.env`
- Previously relied on auto-detection

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Default Configuration** (Groq)
   ```bash
   PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER=groq
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-key
   ```

2. **Test OpenAI**
   ```bash
   PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
   ```

3. **Test Azure**
   ```bash
   PRIMARY_LLM_PROVIDER=azure
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
   ```

4. **Test Fallback**
   ```yaml
   # In settings.yaml
   llm:
     primary_provider: "groq"
     fallback_providers: ["openai"]
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Update any internal documentation referencing the old behavior
2. Inform users about the migration (see `LLM_CONFIGURATION_MIGRATION.md`)
3. Monitor logs for configuration warnings
4. Consider adding configuration validation tests
